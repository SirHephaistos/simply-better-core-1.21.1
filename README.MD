# 🧩 Simply Better Suite

**Simply Better Suite** is a collection of modular **Fabric 1.21.1** mods inspired by the legendary *EssentialsX* plugin.  
It brings back the commands and tools we all grew up with — now rebuilt natively for Fabric servers.

## 🚀 Overview

Simply Better Suite aims to let server owners run a **100% Fabric** server **without losing the classic features** from their favorite multiplayer setups.
