# Code of Conduct

This project is part of several open-source projects I maintain solo. Please help keep it welcoming and respectful.

## Our Standards
- Be respectful, patient, and constructive.
- Assume good intent. Disagree with ideas, not people.
- Use inclusive language. Offer help where you can.
- Keep feedback specific and actionable.

## Unacceptable Behavior
- Harassment, hate speech, or personal attacks.
- Discriminatory or demeaning comments.
- Trolling, off-topic spamming, or disruptive behavior.
- Publishing others’ private information without consent.

## Scope
This Code applies in all project spaces: Issues, PRs, Discussions, Docs, and any community channels related to the project.

## Reporting
If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior:
- Email: **sirhephaistos@gmail.com**
- Discord: **@sir_hephaistos**
  Please include links, screenshots, and context. I’ll review as soon as possible; response times may vary since I’m a single maintainer.

## Enforcement
- I may take any action deemed appropriate, including warnings, content removal, temporary or permanent bans from project spaces.
- Repeated or severe violations may result in escalated actions.
- Appeals can be sent to the contact above.

## Attribution
This Code of Conduct is inspired by common open-source norms and community guidelines.
