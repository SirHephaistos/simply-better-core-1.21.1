# Contributing Guide

Thanks for thinking about contributing — you’re welcome here!

## Before You Start
- **Please read the docs first.**
- **Open an Issue or Feature Request** to share your idea or bug.
- **Wait for the discussion/green light** before writing code. We’d like to avoid work on things that won’t be added.

## How We Work
- Use the Issue to align on problem, scope, and approach.
- Maintainers will confirm if it’s in scope and how we’d like to tackle it.

## Development Flow
- No direct pushes to the default branch.
- Fork the repo → create a branch from the latest default branch.
- Keep changes focused. One logical change per PR is best.
- Update tests and docs when needed.

## Commits & PRs
- Write clear commit messages (Conventional Commits welcome: `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`).
- Make sure CI passes (build, test, lint).
- Link the Issue in your PR (e.g., “Closes #123”).
- Fill out the PR template and request a review.

## Questions?
- Not sure about something? Open a **Discussion** or an **Issue** with the “question” label.
- Please search the docs and existing Issues first to avoid duplicates.

## Security
- Don’t file public Issues for vulnerabilities.
- Use the private contact in `SECURITY.md`.

## License
By contributing, you agree your contributions are licensed under this project’s LICENSE.
