# Security Policy

Thanks for helping keep this project safe. This is one of several open-source projects I maintain **solo**, so friendly heads-ups and patience are appreciated.

## Report a Vulnerability
Please **don’t** open a public Issue or PR.

- Email: **sirhephaistos@gmail.com**  
  Subject: `[SBS SECURITY - MOD] <short summary>`
- Discord: **@sir_hephaistos**

Include:
- Affected version/commit and environment
- Repro steps or PoC
- Expected vs. actual behavior
- Impact and suggested severity (CVSS welcome)

## Response & Timelines
I’ll try to acknowledge within **72 hours** and share a status update within **7 days**. Timelines may vary since I’m a one-person maintainer across multiple projects.

## Supported Versions
Security fixes target the **default branch** and the **most recent release** when practical.

## Coordinated Disclosure
I follow coordinated disclosure. We’ll agree on timelines, validate the fix, and credit you (unless you prefer not to be named). No bug bounty is offered.

## Safe Harbor
Good-faith research is welcome. You’re in safe harbor if you:
- Avoid privacy violations and data exfiltration
- Do not disrupt services
- Give me reasonable time to remediate before public disclosure

## Not Security?
For general bugs and feature ideas, please open an **Issue** or **Discussion** instead. Thanks again for helping improve the project.
